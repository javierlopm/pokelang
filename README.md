# pokelang
Pokelang is a general purpose, pokemon-based programming language. It was developed as a six-month project for the elective course of Programming Languages at Universidad Simón Bolívar. 

This language supports most of common types, arithmetic and logical operators, control structures (if, while, for, and case), 2d-class procedures and functions, recursion, block nesting, line and block comments, compound data structures (record) and unions. Likewise, this is an imperative and strongly typed language. Learn it if you want to be the very best, like no one ever was, to compile it’s your real test and to program is your cause.

This document is designed to give the specification for the language syntax and semantics, required to know in order to implement any program using it.
