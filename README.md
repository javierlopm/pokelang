# pokelang
A pokemon programming language. Learn it if you want to be the very best, like no one ever was, to compile it is your real test and to program it is your cause.

Pokelang is an imperative and structured programming language, it is designed to be compiled. In this lenguage you might find some similarities with C, python, ruby and haskell.

## Scopes
This language supports nested program blocks and it's statically scoped.

Global variables must be defined outside program blocks using the reserved word GLOBAt. These global variables can be seen everywhere in the program, and are hidden only on program blocks that redeclare them.

Local variables must be declared at the begining of a program block, and will be visible inside that block, hidden only inside nested blocks that redeclares that identifier.

## Types
Pokelang includes the primitives data types

| Type  | Label       | Size (bytes)  |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
|  Int  | pINTachu    | 4             |
|  bool | BOOLbasaur  | 4             |
|  float| butterFloat | 4             |
|  char | CHARmander  | 4             |
|  void | VOIDtorb    | NO            |
|  char | CHARmander  |               |
|  pointer | *        | 4             |

Integers are stored in 2's complement.

Bools are represented with the words 0x1 and 0x0.

Floating porint numbers are 32 bits precision with the IEEE 754 standar.

Void type variables cannot be stored

Pointers of any primitive type are 32 bits.
